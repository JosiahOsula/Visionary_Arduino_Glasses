The Arduino Visionary glasses project is an independent project of mine that I have been working on for some time. The goal of this project was to make a pair of glasses that can Aid as a sensory aid for people who are visually impaired.

The glass detects the distance from an object using ultrasonic sensors and sends feedback to the user using small vibration Motors. when an object comes within a certain distance of the user the motor will buzz behind the respective sensor. There are many different ways that this particular feature can be implemented. I chose to use arrays and iterate through the arrays at the same time with the same index.

I think that you could also use inheritance and a company with every sensor with a motor so that when  the sensor is initialized in the program the motor is also initialized and anything that is received from the sensor can be directly read to the motor rather than indirectly comparing them using an array. 

There will also be posted schematics of the full layout of the implemented circuit for the glasses and the final results stay tuned for more
